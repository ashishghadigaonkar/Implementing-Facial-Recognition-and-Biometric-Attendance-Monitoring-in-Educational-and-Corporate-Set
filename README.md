## Project Description 
The project aims to implement facial recognition and biometric attendance monitoring in educational and corporate settings. We are a team of technology enthusiasts who are passionate about simplifying attendance tracking in various settings.

The traditional methods of attendance tracking, such as paper-based systems or manual entry, are time-consuming and error-prone. With the advancement of facial recognition and biometric technologies, we believe that attendance tracking can be simplified, made more secure, and made more efficient.

This project aims to develop an application that uses facial recognition and biometric technologies to track attendance in real-time. By leveraging these technologies, we aim to eliminate the need for traditional paper-based systems, saving time for administrators, teachers, and employees. Additionally, our solution will improve the accuracy and accountability of attendance tracking, leading to a safer and more productive environment for all stakeholders.

We plan to target educational and corporate settings that struggle with attendance tracking and are looking for a more efficient and secure solution. Our solution will be user-friendly and easily accessible, making it appealing to a wide variety of people.
